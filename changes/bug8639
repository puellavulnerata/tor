  o Normal bugfixes:
     - When launching a resolve request on behalf of an AF_UNIX control
       socket, set the address field of the new entry connection, used in
       subsequent events, to "(Tor_internal)" rather than letting
       tor_dup_addr() set it to "<unknown address type>".  Fixes bug 8639.
