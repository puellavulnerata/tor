    - Implementation of SocksSocket option - SocksSocket implements a SOCKS
      proxy reachable by Unix Domain Socket. This allows client applications to
      communicate with Tor without having the ability to create AF_INET or
      AF_INET6 family sockets. If an application has permission to create a socket
      with AF_UNIX, it may directly communicate with Tor as if it were an other
      SOCKS proxy. This should allow high risk applications to be entirely prevented
      from connecting directly with TCP/IP, they will be able to only connect to the
      internet through AF_UNIX and only through Tor.
