  o Bugfixes:
    - Change orconn test in connection_handle_event_cb() from conn->type ==
      CONN_TYPE_OR && conn->state == OR_CONN_STATE_CONNECTING to two nested if
      clauses so we don't incorrectly fall through to the generic case and
      use connection_mark_for_close() on an orconn with conn->state !=
      OR_CONN_STATE_CONNECTING.  Fixes bug #11307.
