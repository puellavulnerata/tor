 * A circuitmux is a collection of circuits; it tracks which subset

 * to transmit) and how many cells on each.  It expoes three distinct
 * interfaces to other components:
 *
 * To channels, which each have a circuitmux_t, the supported operations
 * are:
 *
 * circuitmux_flush_cells():
 *
 *   Retrieve a cell from one of the active circuits, chosen according to
 *   the circuitmux_t's cell selection policy.
 *
 * circuitmux_unlink_all():
 *
 *   The channel is closing down, all circuits must be detached.
 *
 * To circuits, the exposed operations are:
 *
 *   TODO

 * To circuit selection policies, the exposed operations are:
 *
 *   TODO

 * General status inquiries?
